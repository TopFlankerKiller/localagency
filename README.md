This repository simulates a Django project with users,occupations and the connection between them.

It is a CRUD app which takes advantage of the django fm forms
in order to manipulate easily the created instances of the classes
defined in the models.py file of our project.

For more information on how to use modal-fm forms please take a look at the documentation here:https://github.com/django-fm/django-fm
and also to my uploaded How to create and manipulate modal windows using django-fm.pdf file.
